<h2>Education</h2>


<ul>
	<li><h3>Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ | 2018</h3></li>
	<ul>
		<p>B.A. in Broadcasting and Visual Media, College of Communication and the Arts, 2018</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Specialization in Film</li>
				<li>Minor in Sound Production and Engineering</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<ul>
	<li><h3>Media Technician at On the Spot Media, Secaucus, NJ | 2019-Current</h3></li>
	<ul>
		<p>In America we have such an oblong relationship with advertising. It's everywhere we look. I believe some of my most impactful work here is being able to work on advertising material for life-saving services, like Life Alert Medical Systems and BayCare Hospitals, as well as those impacted by damage in need of help or legal compenstation. Things like Cancer settlements, car accident assistance, 
			substance abuse help, IRS tax debt relief, and settlements due to adverse effects of medical and consumer products.
			Some daily tasks include:
		</p>	
			<ul>
				<li>Video editing and post-production</li>
				<li>Audio editing and vocal mixing</li>
				<li>Closed captioning services</li>
				<li>Quality control on video and audio assets</li>
				<li>Analyzing video metadata and CODECs</li>

			</ul>
		<p>Taking time to give the best captioning service also makes me feel positively about maintaining accessibility in media. In my experience I find that many companies are choosing to automate the captioning process to cut costs, and as someone who works in the video field, I can note the stark drop in quality of captioning services in television today. So I take pride in offering
			the most I can to the captioning process in order to ensure the best quality of messaging, especially for the Spanish language captions I work with, an area I feel is direly overlooked in American media as well.</p>

<ul>
	<li><h3>Broadcaster at WSOU, South Orange, NJ, 2017-2019</h3></li>
	<ul>
		<p>Legendary, award-winning NJ radio station. Fortunate to have worked as a DJ and Newscaster here. Playing metal music and getting to talk on air was such a enrichening experience, 
			as well as engaging with and informing the listeners in New Jersey. Definitely an unforgettable experience. Maybe I should work in radio soon.

				<li>Video editing and post-production</li>
				<li>Audio editing and vocal mixing</li>
				<li>Closed captioning services</li>
				<li>Quality control on video and audio assets</li>
				<li>Analyzing video metadata and CODECs</li>

			</ul>
		<p>Another great pride from working at WSOU with its mainly metal audience was running a specialty format
